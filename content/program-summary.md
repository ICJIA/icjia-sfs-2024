## SFS Program Model

The core components of the SFS program model include:

• Coalition-Building: Partnerships with community-based agencies and other local and state organizations serving children exposed to violence and their families;

• Direct Services: Assessment, service plan development, individual/group therapy and case management, re-assessment, psychoeducation; and

• Public Awareness: Community outreach and education.

### Coalition-Building and Collaboration

Coalition building, collaboration, and coordination are central components of the SFS program model. State and local agency, including community-based organizations, collaboration and coordination is required. SFS Coalitions develop strategies to build relationships with community partners to establish referrals into the program as well as link program participants with referrals in the community.

SFS coalitions include a variety of partners. Required partners represent key points of entry for prevention of violence exposure and trauma and intervention services. Recommended partners provide additional support resources. Required and recommended partners may vary based on program need and communities’ existing service delivery systems.

Required Partners:

- Child advocacy centers
- Child welfare agencies
- Victim service agencies, including but not limited to domestic violence and sexual assault services
- Head Start; pre-school and early childhood programs; and childcare providers
- Illinois Department of Children and Family Services/child welfare agencies
- Law enforcement agencies
- Sexual assault agencies
- Healthcare providers including medical and mental/behavioral health professionals

Recommended Partners:

- People with Lived Experience
- Partner Abuse Intervention Programs
- Community leaders/stakeholders, including members with community influence
- Courts: judges, attorneys, guardian ad litems, court appointed special advocates, victim-witness advocates, administrative staff of dependency/juvenile, family, domestic violence, and drug courts
- Crisis nurseries
- Early intervention programs, such as your local Child and Family Connections for ages 0 to 3
- Faith-based leaders
- Family case management: e.g., WIC, child protective services, family support services, child welfare agencies, foster care programs
- Hospitals, emergency medical services, primary health care providers
- Housing authorities
- Local parent groups (e.g., PTA)
- Schools, including special education programs
- Social service agencies

### Direct Services

Safe From the Start primarily serves young children (birth to 5 years of age) who have been exposed to violence in the home or community and their families or caregivers. “Exposure to violence” is defined as being a victim or witness of abuse, neglect, or maltreatment or a witness to domestic, physical, or sexual violence, or other violent crime. Children older than five years maybe served if the primary client is ages 0-5.

While sites may operate differently, a core of case management and clinical staff must provide direct services to children and their families. Programs are highly encouraged to recruit professionals from the community to provide direct services, whenever possible. SFS sites must develop referral/outreach system that addresses confidentiality issues. Additionally, sites must create a SFS Coalition that addresses the implementation organizational change, enhancement of information sharing and management information systems protocol creation, and other related tasks. Direct services shall include an intake and assessment process (including evaluation and post-service assessment) and clinical and family support services.

Upon referral, a SFS staff member will meet with the primary caregiver and child(ren) to share SFS services and assess their needs. During the first few visits, select assessment tools must be completed with the primary caregiver for each child receiving services. These assessment tools allow the staff and the larger SFS program and evaluation team to understand what children exposed to violence are experiencing and how to best support them. They also serve as an educational tool for the caregiver and can facilitate relationship building between SFS staff and family. Clinical supervision of therapists is required for this program.

### Public Awareness

The SFS program model’s third component is public awareness. Efforts to involve community members, increase public awareness, incorporate community input during planning, and educate residents about the scope of the problem are essential. These efforts range from community presentations, community events, professional trainings, media campaigns, and other methods for increasing awareness of childhood exposure to violence.
