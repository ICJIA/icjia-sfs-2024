## Overview

SFS’s goals include the development, implementation, and evaluation of comprehensive, coordinated responses to CEV and trauma. Data gathered from young children and caregivers during SFS’s assessment process is analyzed to learn more about program efficacy, strengths, and areas for improvement. Various instruments are used to assess children’s and caregivers’ experiences and service provision. Tools include:

- Background Information Form (BIF)
- Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ)
- Ages and Stages Social-Emotional Questionnaire (ASQ-SE)
- Safe From the Start Questionnaire (SFSQ)
- Child Behavior Checklist 1.5-5 (CBCL)
- Parenting Stress Index – Short Form (PSI)
- Child Completion of Services Form
- Caregiver Completion of Services Form[^1]

## Impact

Research on the SFS program, documented in the [State Fiscal Year 2020 Safe From the Start Annual Report: 2001-2020](https://icjia.illinois.gov/researchhub/articles/state-fiscal-year-2020-safe-from-the-start-annual-report-2001-2020/), revealed beneficial client outcomes. Intake data collected from nine SFS sites showed that 81% of children who received SFS services had witnessed domestic violence, 41% were experiencing behavioral and emotional challenges, and 39% were at risk of social-emotional delays. Additionally, intake data showed elevated stress levels in caregivers. Statistics showed that post-program involvement, caregivers’ knowledge about the impact of trauma increased, the children’s ability to identify feelings improved, caregiver stress was reduced, and a significant reduction in children’s overall emotional and behavioral symptoms was recorded.[^2]
