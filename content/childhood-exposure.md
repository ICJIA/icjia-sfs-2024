Childhood exposure to violence (CEV) is pervasive and negatively impacts communities. CEV includes experiencing or witnessing physical abuse, sexual assault, maltreatment/neglect, domestic violence, and other violent crimes. In its third National Survey of Children’s Exposure to Violence, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that almost 58% of children and youth between 0 and 17 years old had been exposed to at least one type of violence; 48% had experienced more than one type of victimization within the previous year.<sup>[\[1\]](#footnote-2)</sup> The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ 2020 Child Maltreatment report series revealed 618,000 children in the United States were victims of child abuse and neglect; 29% of them were under age two.<sup>[\[2\]](#footnote-3)</sup> The U.S. Advisory Board on Child Abuse suggests domestic violence may be the single major precursor to child abuse and neglect fatalities in the county.<sup>[\[3\]](#footnote-4)</sup>

Experiencing or witnessing one or more types of violence can have profound effects on child development. For example, children who have been physically abused are at a higher risk for malnutrition, diabetes, and chronic health problems.<sup>[\[4\]](#footnote-5)</sup> Psychological outcomes include diminished executive functioning, poor mental health, and post-traumatic stress disorder.4 Social consequences involve the associated risks of substance dependency, delinquency, teen pregnancy, engaging in risky sexual behaviors, and perpetrating violence.4 The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) Study demonstrated that childhood maltreatment or trauma can be correlated to adult health problems later in life and early death.<sup>[\[5\]](#footnote-6)</sup>

However, many children can live healthy lives despite exposure to violence. These resilient children often have at least one positive adult role model in their lives.<sup>[\[6\]](#footnote-7)</sup> Furthermore, research shows early interventions for children and families exposed to violence can reduce symptoms related to violence exposure, enhance protective factors, and increase child safety.<sup>[\[7\]](#footnote-8)</sup>
